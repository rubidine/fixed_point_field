# Fixed Point Field specifies that a field that is accessed like a float from
# a rails script should be stored as an integer in the database.  This is only
# practical when the field always has a fixed number of digits after the
# decimal place, like how US Dollars have 2 digits of cents after the decimal.
# More information and examples are available in the README.

  # of the class, we need to add methods to the class object, do this

    # available for in integer field that return / accept values that are
    # floating point.  It will convert them to integer values by up-scaling
    # the number by a certain number of decimal places.  This is most useful
    # for working with money, when the values can be stored as cents, but
    # will most often be working with dollars, which always has two places
    # after the decimal reserved for cents.
    #
    # Takes any number of field names to be converted, and an optional
    # hash as the last argument.  The hash can have keys of :width, which
    # is the number of places beyond the decimal to use (default 2), and
    # :base, which is the number system to use (default 10 [decimal]).

    #   * my_field= - takes a floating point number and scales it appropriately
